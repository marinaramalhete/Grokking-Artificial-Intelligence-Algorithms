# Artificial Neural Network
# Let’s walk through the phases and different operations involved in the back propagation algorithm.

# Phase A: Setup

# 1.	Define ANN architecture: This involves defining the input nodes, the output nodes, the number of hidden layers,
# the number of neurons in each hidden layer, the activation functions used, and more. We will dive into some of these
# details in the next section. For now, we will stick to the same ANN architecture that we have already used in the
# previous section.

# 2.	Initialize ANN weights: The weights in the ANN must be initialized to some value. There are various approaches
# to this, however, the key principle is that the weights will be constantly adjusted as the ANN learns from training
# examples but we need to start somewhere.

# Phase B: Forward propagation: This is the same process that we covered in the previous section. The same calculations
# are carried out; however, the predicted output will be compared with the actual class for each example in the training
# set to train the network.

# Phase C: Training
# 1.	Calculate cost: Following from forward propagation, the cost is the difference between the predicted output and
# the actual class for the examples in the training set. The cost is effectively determining how bad the ANN is at
# predicting the class of examples.

# 2.	Update weights in the ANN: The weights of the ANN are the only thing that can be adjusted by the network itself.
# The architecture and configurations that we defined in phase A doesn’t change during training the network. The weights
# are essentially encoding the “intelligence” of the network. Weights are adjusted to be larger or smaller which impacts
# the strength of the inputs.

# 3.	Stopping condition: Training cannot happen indefinitely. Similarly to many of the algorithms explored in this
# book, a sensible stopping condition needs to be determined. If we have a large dataset, we might decide that we will
# use 500 examples in our training dataset over 1000 iterations to train the ANN. This means that the 500 examples will
# be passed through the network 1000 times and adjust the weights in every iteration.

# Scale a dataset to values between 0 and 1 using min-max scaling
