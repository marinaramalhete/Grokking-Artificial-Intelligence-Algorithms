# The Perceptron
# The neuron is the fundamental concept that makes up the brain and nervous systems.
# It accepts many inputs from other neurons, processes those inputs, and transfers the result to other “connected”
# neurons. Artificial neural networks are based on the fundamental concept of the Perceptron. The Perceptron is a
# logical representation of a single biological neuron.
